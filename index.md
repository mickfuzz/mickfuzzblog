## Welcome

Welcome to the front page of  Mick's writing blog.

This blog starts in 2025. It is in part a reaction to being in the end stages of my PhD writing. It also marks around 4 years after founding the Todmorden Makery workshop. I want to to reflect on those process in relation to past work. And to reflect forward on how that could shape upcoming work and life goals.
