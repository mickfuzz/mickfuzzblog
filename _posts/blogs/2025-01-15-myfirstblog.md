title: My first Blog by Mick Fuzz

## My first blog.

I can remember my first blog. Or can I?

No not really. I would love to say I do. But the process of expressing views and sharing information online was something that I started doing a while before blogs existed.

The first website I did was a fanzine which ran out of the Herbal Tea Party music night. I put some of the articles up online with the help of volunteers as the Hulme community computing centre. I feel like I have some writing on that already somewhere. I'll try to find it.

You see, some of this is coming out of my PhD writing. Things that I wrote which seem important to me but which don't really fit into the structure of PhD chapters. Let me see if I can find it. I'll search my PhD repository of "Hulme Community"

Here's a bit I wrote on 2023.

I'll leave it there for now!

nice one

In the middle of regenerated Hulme on the corner opposite the Birley fields campus is a squat unassuming building called the church of the Ascension. A part from being  a site of sanctuary for the political refugee Virag Mendes in a notable anti-deportation campaign of the 1980s, it was also the site of one of Europe's first electronic village halls. In 1996, as an unemployed recent graduate and new editor of a fanzine on the fledling electronic music scene centred around the Hulme venues of the Nia centre and New Adri, I was directed to this centre as it had the software Abiword which had the ability to print out rounded text boxes, a feature I thought would look pretty snazzy cut and pasted over over-photocopied backgrounds from 2000AD. No physical place in the UK seemed to better live out the counter-cultural, dystopian, cyberpunk ethic popularised by 2000AD and the author William Gibson. At the Hulme Community Computing Centre Pete, the friendly hippy volunteer who facilitated my fanzine printing encouraged me to make a website of the fanzine. On later visits he gave me a print out of a website that detailed how to write HTML web pages and offered free webspace as part of the HCCC site. Pete was enthusiastic about the Unix operating system common mostly on web servers and university computers.

This spirit of peer-learning combined with my desire to share the ethos of the DIY music scene fuelled many years of using the internet to promote unlicensed music events. In 1995 and 1996, the internet, like Hulme, seemed to be a corporate free space, a space for oddballs, niche enthusiasts and more importantly activists. This period saw increasing alignment with the growth of the internet to link up activities of disparate political and cultural groups around gatherings international finance institution (IFIs). For me this culminated in helping to organise and promote an event for June 18th 1999. Similar carnival-themed events drew on the blue print of reclaim the streets mixing street blockaded by outdoor sound systems. While the site of street party and protests as a chaotic and inspirational environment has been explored [@carmo_reclaim_2012; @jordan_notes_2005].

I have been inspired by the possibilities of the party and protest movement as an inspirational site of learning. My involvement with the movement led me to help develop my internet publishing skills aligning myself with a broad network of media and internet activists centred around the Indymedia project. On a personal level, my development as a media activist including but not limited to: graphic design; web page creation; computer programming; video editing; audio-visual events tech; and server maintenance was driven with motivation and support provided by people involved in that scene.
